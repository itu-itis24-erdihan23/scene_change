Video Shot Boundary Detection using SVD
This project identifies scene changes in videos by combining pixel-level intensity analysis (Total Absolute Difference) and structural feature extraction through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). It features a custom SVD implementation based on eigenvalue decomposition.
